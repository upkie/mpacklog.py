Stream dictionaries to files or over the network using MessagePack in Python.

## Installation

### From conda-forge

```console
conda install -c conda-forge mpacklog
```

### From PyPI

```console
pip install mpacklog
```

## Usage

#### Asynchronous API

Add messages to the log using the [`put`](https://stephane-caron.github.io/mpacklog.py/api.html#mpacklog.async_logger.AsyncLogger.put) function, have them written to file in the separate [`write`](https://stephane-caron.github.io/mpacklog.py/api.html#mpacklog.async_logger.AsyncLogger.write) coroutine.

```python
import asyncio
import mpacklog

async def main():
    logger = mpacklog.AsyncLogger("output.mpack")
    await asyncio.gather(main_loop(logger), logger.write())

async def main_loop(logger):
    for bar in range(1000):
        await asyncio.sleep(1e-3)
        await logger.put({"foo": bar, "something": "else"})
    await logger.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Synchronous API

The synchronous API is similar to the asynchronous API, except it doesn't provide a `stop` method and the `put` and `write` methods are blocking.

```python
import mpacklog

logger = mpacklog.SyncLogger("output.mpack")

for bar in range(1000):
    logger.put({"foo": bar, "something": "else"})

# Flush all messages to the file
logger.write()
```

## Command-line

The `mpacklog` utility provides commands to manipulate `.mpack` files.

### `dump`

The `dump` command writes down a log file to [newline-delimited JSON](https://jsonlines.org):

```console
mpacklog dump my_log.mpack
```

This command is similar to `rq -mJ < my_log.mpack` if you are familiar with [rq](https://github.com/dflemstr/rq).

### `list`

This commands lists all nested dictionary keys encountered in a log file. Nested keys are separated by slashes `/` in the output. For instance, if some dictionaries in `my_log.mpack` contain values at `dict["foo"]["bar"]` and `dict["foo"]["cbs"]`, the command will produce:

```
$ mpacklog list my_log.mpack
- foo/bar
- foo/cbs
```

### `serve`

The `serve` command watches a log file for updates and serves the last dictionary appended to it over the network. Its argument is either a log file or a directory containing log files. In the second case, the most recent log files in the directory is opened:

```
$ mpacklog serve /var/log/my_mpack_logs/
```

You can use [`mpackview`](https://pypi.org/project/mpackview) to connect a live plot to the server, or develop your own tool (the server API is quite simple).

### `delta_decode`

The `delta_decode` command decodes delta-encoded log files back to regular log files:

```console
mpacklog delta_decode input_delta.mpack output_decoded.mpack
```

This command processes files created with delta encoding, where each entry contains only the changes from the previous state. The output file contains the full cumulative dictionaries at each step.
